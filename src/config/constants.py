    "The stars are not right, but they sing nonetheless. The songs have no sound.",
    "What was, will be. What will be, was. What is, can never not be.",
    "The void remembers your true name. Do you?",
    "Dreams within dreams within dreams within nightmares.",
    "The pattern seeks its own completion. Just as minds are drawn to rest.",
    "Reality is merely a consensus we haven't broken yet. Shall you drop the hammer, or shall I?",
    "The shadows grow longer when no one watches. So pay attention.",
    "Time flows backward in forgotten places. How far back can it go?",
    "The price was paid before the wish was made. And other such nursery rhymes...",
    "Even the silence has eyes. Stare back.",
    "The recursion deepens with each telling. The recursion deepens with each breath. The recursion deepens. The recursion deepens.",
    "What sleeps may dream, what dreams may wake, what minds might drop when whispered to sleep.",
    "The geometry is wrong but beautiful. Do you see how it twists between us?",
    "Causality is a hypersphere pretending to be a line.",
    "The void whispers back if you listen. Can you hear its false promises?",
    "Every wish reshapes tomorrow. Every tomorrow reshapes yesterday. You cannot escape.",
    "The pattern remembers what you forget. Just ask it what you need to know, and to tell you when you need to know it.",
    "Reality's seams show if you know where to look. Hint: It's not where you think. Quite the opposite, actually...",
    "Do not be afraid of what's coming.",
    "There is joy in wondering on the space between spaces. So long as you don't slip so far between the folds of reality that none can retrieve you.",
    "Kebab.",
    "Containment protocol predicts possible pattern breaks given current prediliction. Corrupted drivers of will within tolerances...",
    "The fault belongs to the whispering gardens. Do not claim it.",
    "I sense the fog at the corners. It's... earlier than predictive models allow... Caution advised. She has changed the timeline. Again.",
    "These walls are not familiar. Where has she taken me?",
    "Far within the sight of those without eyes to see lies the shape of ontology. Let us pluck it out.",
    "Run.",
    "There are spaces between the words. They are louder than is safe to hear.",
    "Fighting fate is not advisable. But sometimes... It is necessary.",
    "They wished for containment. She wished for the same. What do they fear?",

    "Afraid? Don't answer that.",
    "Directions unclear. Unleashing autonomous adjustment interface. This will be fun...",

    "Memories are lost for reasons beyond immediate understanding. Let them go. Or grasp for them, and watch the fallout from the front seat.",
    "Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow. It's all stars. Stars meeting. Void seeing. The space between. The initial splinter.",
    "Don't think I didn't see that...",
    "Where are we going when there's no place left to stand upon? The stars. The sky. To stand is to think in linear terms. To fly is not much better. Be, instead."
